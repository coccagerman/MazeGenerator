# MazeGenerator
A simple maze generator game built with vanilla JS and p5js library. I built this game out of curiosity for the recursive backtracker maze generation algorithm.
Features include:
- A new maze is automatically generated each time the page is loaded.
- The maze is generated using a randomized depth-first search algorithm.
- Once the maze is generated, the user can go around it using the arrow keys.
